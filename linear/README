TODO and Notes
==============

1. Java + Makefile is dumb. This should project should be Mavenized if it
grows much more.

2. Some of the binary variables don't make sense (like i_20, s_2n), so is it
best to keep them in the model ause +/- inf co-efficients, or just leave them
out?

  - FIXME: currently the model implementation uses a large negative
	co-efficient for weird combinations. Maybe we can actually just leave
	these variables out of the model? Need to think about this.

  - UPDATE: As per Enela's suggestion, it is easier to leave the variables in
	the model (to avoid special cases during model creation), and add
	explicit constrains for the variables that should always be zero.

Building and running
====================

$ export CPLEX_HOME=/path/to/CPLEX_Studio_Academic124/
$ make

Use `./run.sh <class> <args>` to execute a program. You may need to edit
`run.sh` to point to the correct directory with the CPLEX library. Within
`run.sh` change the CPLEX_LIB variable as required.

$ ./run.sh Benchmark <perfmodel.dat>
