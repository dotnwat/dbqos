TODO and Notes
==============

1. Java + Makefile is dumb. This should project should be Mavenized if it
grows much more.

2. Some of the binary variables don't make sense (like i_20, s_2n), so is it
best to keep them in the model ause +/- inf co-efficients, or just leave them
out?

  - FIXME: currently the model implementation uses a large negative
	co-efficient for weird combinations. Maybe we can actually just leave
	these variables out of the model? Need to think about this.

Building and running
====================

$ export CPLEX_HOME=/path/to/CPLEX_Studio_Academic124/
$ make

Use `./run.sh <class> <args>` to execute a program. You may need to edit
`run.sh` to point to the correct directory with the CPLEX library. Within
`run.sh` change the CPLEX_LIB variable as required.

$ ./run.sh Benchmark <perfmodel.dat>
